# Writing the website (2023/02/04)

I've worked a little bit in the past on existing websites, but I've never built
a full one from the ground up before; that has always been a bit of a blind spot for me.
I also _really_ like developing in Rust, so I think this is a good opportunity for me to
try something I haven't done - build a website using only Rust, HTML, and CSS.

## Initial features
I want to scope the initial rollowut down to a set of easier tasks. Broad-strokes, they are as follows:

- Have a homepage with a small introduction
- Have a blog section, where I can post these writeups
- Allow Markdown blog posts so I don't need to write these in HTML
- Light styling so that things look nice

The site will start as a static page, and all blog posts will be downloaded on page load.

## Stretch goals
Once the initial goals are complete, it might make sense to implement these features:

- Host blog posts on the server and pull when requested
- Add blog previews to the blog page

After I accomplish these goals, I'll use the site as a playground to experiment with some Rust/WASM apps.

## Implementing website scaffolding
I opted to use the `leptos` framework for building the website. I didn't put too much thought into why to 
use this framework over something like `yew` or `egui`, other than that it's a fairly hyped-up framework.

To get a simple header with a picture and title, it was fairly easy, but I needed to wrestle with the 
framework a bit. What I landed on was the following; let's see if it lasts.

*main.rs*:
```rust
use components::app::{App, AppProps};
use leptos::{mount_to_body, view};

mod components;

fn main() {
    _ = console_log::init_with_level(log::Level::Debug);
    console_error_panic_hook::set_once();
    mount_to_body(|cx| {
        view! { cx,
            <App/>
        }
    })
}
```

*components/app.rs*:
```rust
use leptos::{component, IntoView, view, Scope};
use crate::components::intro::{Intro, IntroProps};

#[component]
pub fn App(cx: Scope) -> impl IntoView {
    view! { cx, 
        <Intro/>
    }
}
```

*components/intro.rs*
```rust
use leptos::{component, IntoView, view, Scope};

#[component]
pub fn Intro(cx: Scope) -> impl IntoView {
    view! { cx, 
        <div>
            <img src="assets/profile_pic.jpeg"/>
            <p>
                <h1> "Jason Allen" </h1>
                <span> "Backend software dev" </span>
            </p>
        </div>
    }
}
```

Let's take a look at the implementation. 

```rust
    _ = console_log::init_with_level(log::Level::Debug);
    console_error_panic_hook::set_once();
```

This section of code makes logs and panics show up in the console in the browser.

```rust
    mount_to_body(|cx| {
        view! { cx,
            <App/>
        }
    })
```

This section is interesting, and shows some of the interesting metaprogramming you can do with Rust macros.
The `view!` macro allows us to write a fully different syntax which has its own error checking determined 
by the library maintainer. We see a better example of this here:

```rust
use leptos::{component, IntoView, view, Scope};

#[component]
pub fn Intro(cx: Scope) -> impl IntoView {
    view! { cx, 
        <div class="heading">
            <img class="heading-item profile-pic" src="assets/profile_pic.jpeg"/> 
            <p class="heading heading-item">
                <h1> "Jason Allen" </h1>
                <span> "Backend software dev" </span>
            </p>
        </div>
    }
}
```

This is a more fleshed out HTML blob. Let's take a look at what happens when we `cargo build` after 
changing `<h1> "Jason Allen" </h1>` to `<h1> "Jason Allen"`.

```
   Compiling website v0.1.0 (/Users/jasonallen/dev/website)
error: close tag has no corresponding open tag
  --> src/components/intro.rs:11:13
   |
11 |             </p>
   |             ^

error: could not compile `website` due to previous error
```

This error is also visible while editing if your editor is integrated with the rust-analyzer language server.
It's not the best error, as it's not referring to the right tag, but this functionality seems interesting
nonetheless.

## Integrating with Trunk
Now, I need to set up everything to be packaged and built into website that I can host. I'll utilize `trunk` for this.

First, install trunk:

```bash
cargo install trunk
```

Trunk can be configured to package things into a `dist` directory which will contain the content downloaded to browsers.
This is set up using a root `index.html` file. Mine contains the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link data-trunk rel="copy-dir" href="assets/">
        <title>Jason Allen</title>
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```

This tells trunk to bundle the contents of the `assests` directory into the generated `dist` directory, so that loading the page also loads the assets in the directory.

## Integrating with Tailwind CSS

I'm pretty bad at CSS. I could cobble together some CSS that works, but that would likely be difficult to maintain and lead to a genuinely bizarre design.
Tailwind offers some pre-built CSS that you can cobble together to make a site without implementing any CSS yourself.

This part took a little bit of doing, as Tailwind is not developed specifically to deal with Rust frameworks.
It worked surprisingly well just by editing a few config files, though. First, I installed the Tailwind CLI tool with

```bash
npm install -g taiwindcss
```

I initialized a `tailwind.config.js` file with `npx tailwindcss init` and created a template CSS file in `css/tailwind.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

We can generate the CSS file with `npx tailwindcss -i css/tailwind.css -o css/tailwind.generated.css`
and tell our build tool to include the `css/tailwind.generated.css` file in the bundle that's served to the client.
I used `trunk` to serve the site on my dev environment, and I just needed to add the following build step to my `Trunk.toml`:

```toml
[[hooks]]
stage = "pre_build"
command = "sh"
command_arguments = ["-c", "npx tailwindcss -i ./css/tailwind.css -o ./css/tailwind.generated.css"]
```

The only thing remaining is to tell Tailwind to look at Rust files to find the CSS classes it needs to generate.
I changed the generated `tailwind.config.js` to

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: ["index.html", "src/**/*.rs"],
}
```

Now, I can add Tailwind classes to my "RSX" code like so (in `src/components/intro.rs`):

```rust
use leptos::{component, view, IntoView, Scope};

#[component]
pub fn Intro(cx: Scope) -> impl IntoView {
    view! { cx,
        <div class="flex p-1 items-center">
            <img class="rounded-full w-32 h-32" src="assets/profile_pic.jpeg"/>
            <p class="align-super p-3">
                <h1 class="text-3xl"> "Jason Allen" </h1>
                <span> "Backend software dev" </span>
            </p>
        </div>
    }
}
```

and Tailwind will handle all of the CSS generation for me. Amazing.
 
Now, I just need to tell Trunk to bundle the generated CSS as part the site's assets. Update `index.html` to

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <link data-trunk rel="copy-dir" href="assets/">
        <link data-trunk rel="copy-file" href="css/tailwind.generated.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/tailwind.generated.css">
        <title>Jason Allen</title>
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>
```

## Integrating with mdbook
In order to remove the need to deal with the details of static site generation myself, I will use `mdbook` to generate the blog pages.
This reduces the control I have over the exact styling of the blog, but makes generating the pages dead simple.

I started by installing mdbook:

```bash
cargo install mdbook
```

and then initializing the book by doing

```bash
mkdir blog
cd blog
mdbook init
```

This autogenerates the directory structure of the book. I copied the markdown for this post into the first chapter's file, and after an `mdbook build`, it looked great out of the box.

I added a new "blog" component to the components of the webpage in `src/blog.rs` with a simple link to the html generated by `mdbook`.
```rust
use leptos::{component, Scope, IntoView, view};

#[component]
pub fn Blog(cx: Scope) -> impl IntoView {
    view! { cx, 
        <a href="book/index.html"> "Blog" </a>
    }
}
```

Again, let's tell trunk to bundle the generated assets with the webpage. I added the following to `index.html`:

```html
<link data-trunk rel="copy-dir" href="blog/book">
```

## Deploying the site through Github Actions
The site is currently a static page served through Github Pages - as such, I want a convenient way to deploy the site through a Github Action, and not need to manually build artifacts to serve.
Here is the workflow I came up with (from `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`):
```yaml
name: Deploy site
on:
  workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions: write-all

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install Rust toolchain
        # You may pin to the exact commit or the version.
        # uses: actions-rs/toolchain@b2417cde72dcf67f306c0ae8e0828a81bf0b189f
        uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1.0.6
        with:
          toolchain: nightly
          override: true
          target: wasm32-unknown-unknown

      - name: Install mdbook
        uses: actions-rs/cargo@v1
        with:
          command: install
          args: mdbook

      - name: Generate blog page
        run: |
          cd blog
          mdbook build

      - name: Install trunk
        uses: jetli/trunk-action@v0.2.0
        with:
          # Optional version of trunk to install(eg. 'v0.8.1', 'latest')
          version: 'latest'

      - name: Build artifacts
        run: trunk build --release

      - name: Upload GitHub Pages artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1.0.7
        with:
          # Path of the directory containing the static assets.
          path: dist

      - name: Deploy GitHub Pages site
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1.2.3
```

The steps here are pretty straightforward.
1. Checkout the revision sepecified.
2. Install the nightly toolchain for Rust.
3. Install mdbook for generating artifacts.
4. Generate the artifacts using mdbook.
5. Build artifacts using trunk.
6. Upload the built artifacts to the hosted page.
7. Deploy the new revision of the page.

The website is now has _light_ styling via Tailwind CSS, is able to interpret Markdown blog posts, and is deployable with one click!
I'll work to improve the page in future posts. I'd like to do the following:
1. Improve the main page with more of a cohesive style and organization, as well as more information.
2. Integrate the blog page so it does not seem like you're navigating to a new page when clicking the blog link.
3. Attempt to apply custom styling to the blog page.
